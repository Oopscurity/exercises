Oopsy Components Library
======================

What is this?
-----------
Oopsy is a library that provides a set of ready to use visual components ([blocks](https://github.com/bem/bem-components/blob/v2/README.md)) for creating web interfaces.

**Note:** the library has not been released yet and now it is in dev mode (pre-alpha). It isn't recommended to use the blocks in production.

Blocks

* [x] [`slider`](common.blocks/slider/README.md)
* [ ] [lightbox](common.blocks/lightbox/README.md)
* [ ] [scroll](common.blocks/scroll/README.md)
